 abstract = {The measurement of functional gene abundance in diverse microbial communities often employs quantitative PCR (qPCR) with highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers. While degenerate PCR primers have been demonstrated to cause template-specific bias in PCR applications, the effect of such bias on qPCR has been less well explored. We used a set of diverse, full-length nifH gene standards to test the performance of several universal nifH primer sets in qPCR. We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.},
