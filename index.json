The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Slackia, Clostridium XI and Faecalibacterium. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue vs. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included Slackia, Roseburia, unclass. Ruminococcaeceae, unclass. Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter. Colorectal tumors are rarely diagnosed in dogs, but despite this limitation, we were able to show that dogs with colorectal tumors have distinct fecal microbiota profiles. These initial results support the need for future case-control studies that are adequately powered, as well as age-matched and breed-matched, in order to evaluate the influence of bacteria on colorectal cancer etiopathogenesis and to determine whether the bacteria may have potential as biomarkers in clinical settings.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of the fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Lavanya Rishishwar","Lina C.

A large number of PCR primer sets have been developed for nifH amplification, and the effective deployment of these approaches should be guided by a rapid, easy-to-use analysis protocol. Bioinformatic analysis of marker gene sequences also requires considerable expertise. In this study, we advance the state of the art for nifH analysis by evaluating nifH primer set performance, developing an improved amplicon sequencing workflow, and implementing a user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline. The developed amplicon sequencing workflow is a three-stage PCR-based approach that uses established technologies for incorporating sample-specific barcode sequences and sequencing adapters. Based on our primer evaluation, we recommend the Ando primer set be used with a modified annealing temperature of 58°C, as this approach captured the largest diversity of nifH templates, including paralog cluster IV/V sequences. To improve nifH sequence analysis, we developed a computational pipeline which infers taxonomy and optionally filters out paralog sequences. In addition, we employed an empirical model to derive optimal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs for the nifH gene at the species, genus, and family levels. A comprehensive workflow script named TaxADivA (TAXonomy Assignment and DIVersity Assessment) is provided to ease processing and analysis of nifH amplicons. Our approach is then validated through characterization of diazotroph communities across environmental gradients in beach sands impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in a peat moss-dominated wetland, and in various plant compartments of a sugarcane field.IMPORTANCE Nitrogen availability often limits ecosystem productivity, and nitrogen fixation, exclusive to prokaryotes, comprises a major source of nitrogen input that sustains food webs. The nifH gene, which codes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme, is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in nature. In this study, a flexible sequencing/analysis pipeline, named TaxADivA, was developed for nifH amplicons produced by Illumina paired-end sequencing, and it enables an inference of taxonomy, performs clustering, and produces output in formats that may be used by programs that facilitate data exploration and analysis. Diazotroph diversity and community composition are linked to ecosystem functioning, and our results advance the phylogenetic characterization of diazotroph communities by providing empirically derived nifH similarity cutoffs for species, genus, and family levels. The utility of our pipeline is validated for diazotroph communities in a variety of ecosystems, including contaminated beach sands, peatland ecosystems, living plant tissues, and rhizosphere soil.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Metagenomics","Next-generation sequencing","Nitrogen fixation","Sequence analysis","Taxonomy"],"title":"Diazotroph community characterization via a highthroughput nifH amplicon sequencing and analysis pipeline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Greses","John Christian Gaby","Daniel Aguado","José Ferrer","Aurora Seco","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0e2c8aa8d6ff3a9d608e66dab3e95db7","permalink":"/publication/greses-2017/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.222455Z","relpermalink":"/publication/greses-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Microbial communities were thoroughly characterized in a mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), which were both treating recalcitrant microalgal biomass dominated by Scenedesmus. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis was performed when the AnMBR achieved 70% algal biodegradation and revealed high microbial diversity, probably due to the high solid retention time (SRT) of the AnMBR configuration. The bacterial community consisted of Chloroflexi (27.9%), WWE1 (19.0%) and Proteobacteria (15.4%) as the major phyla, followed by Spirochaetes (7.7%), Bacteroidetes (5.9%) and Firmicutes (3.6%). These phyla are known to exhibit proteolytic and cellulolytic capabilities required to degrade the Scenedesmus cell-wall. Methanosaeta was the most abundant methanogen detected in the AnMBR suggesting that methane was mainly produced by the acetoclastic pathway. In comparison, the thermophilic CSTR achieved 32.6% algal biodegradation, and its bacterial community had fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (977 OTUs) than the AnMBR (1396 OTUs), as is generally observed for high temperature biogas reactors. However, phyla with high hydrolytic potential were detected such as Firmicutes (34.6%) and the candidate taxon EM3 (38.7%) in the thermophilic CSTR. Although the functional metabolism of EM3 in anaerobic digesters is unknown, the high abundance of EM3 suggests that this taxon plays an important role in the thermophilic, anaerobic degradation of Scenedesmus. The abundant syntrophic bacteria and the detection of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the thermophilic CSTR suggest that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was the dominant pathway for methane production in this reactor.","tags":["Anaerobic digestion","Membrane technology","Microbial community analysis","Scenedesmus spp."],"title":"Microbial community characterization during anaerobic digestion of Scenedesmus spp. under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa J.

A molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria ( Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae ). Despite higher concentrations of dissolved vanadium ([V] 11 nM) than molybdenum ([Mo] 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing, and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water contents. Incorporation of 15 N 2 was suppressed 90% by O 2 and 55% by C 2 H 2 and was unaffected by CH 4 and CO 2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C 2 H 2 -sensitive and C 2 H 2 -insensitive microbes that are more active at low concentrations of O 2 and show similar activity at high and low concentrations of CH 4 .","tags":["Acetylene","Alphaproteobacteria","Diazotrophy","Methanotrophs","Molybdenum","Nitrogen cycle enzymes","Nitrogen fixation","Peatland","Sphagnum","Vanadium"],"title":"Molybdenum-based diazotrophy in a Sphagnum peatland in northern Minnesota","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

While degenerate PCR primers have been demonstrated to cause template-specific bias in PCR applications, the effect of such bias on qPCR has been less well explored. We used a set of diverse, full-length nifH gene standards to test the performance of several universal nifH primer sets in qPCR. We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.","tags":["Amplification bias","Degenerate primers","nifH","qPCR"],"title":"The Use of Degenerate Primers in qPCR Analysis of Functional Genes Can Cause Dramatic Quantification Bias as Revealed by Investigation of nifH Primer Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Mirzaman Zamanzadeh","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"8eda47576df440e61182d37b7d69f448","permalink":"/publication/gaby-2017/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.221948Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gaby-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Temperature-phased anaerobic digestion","Retention t","biogas","microbial community analysis","retention time","temperature-phased anaerobic digestion"],"title":"The effect of temperature and retention time on methane production and microbial community composition in staged anaerobic digesters fed with food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

All rights reserved. Diazotrophic microorganisms are taxonomically and metabolically diverse and they populate a wide variety of habitats. Diazotroph diversity is typically quantified through the analysis of nitrogenase nifH gene sequences recovered from environmental samples. In this chapter we review the global census of diazotrophic microorganisms as assessed by the diversity of nifH gene sequences in public sequence databases. We assess the diversity of diazotrophs found in different environments and taxonomic groupings and we also evaluate PCR primers and probes used to assess diazotroph diversity. Furthermore, we assess the range of habitats and geographic regions in which diazotrophic diversity has been assessed. We find that diazotrophs in many habitats remain under sampled. We also find that nifH cluster III, which includes obligate anaerobes, contains the greatest diversity of nifH sequences and that anoxic environments both contain the greatest diversity of diazotrophs and are the environments in which diazotrophic diversity is most poorly sampled. Our knowledge of diazotroph diversity is likely to expand dramatically as next-generation sequencing technologies are targeted towards surveys of the nifH gene.","tags":["Diversity","Ecology","NifH","Nitrogen fixation","Nitrogenase","PCR","Primers"],"title":"Assessment of Nitrogenase Diversity in the Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H Buckley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5e875659e5842701b660d7fbfb65fae5","permalink":"/publication/gaby-2014/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.224134Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gaby-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe a nitrogenase gene sequence database that facilitates analysis of the evolution and ecology of nitrogen-fixing organisms.

The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having textless3% sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23% dissimilarity in nifH.

Numerous PCR primers have been designed to amplify nifH, but a comprehensive evaluation of nifH PCR primers has not been performed. We performed an in silico analysis of the specificity and coverage of 51 universal and 35 group-specific nifH primers by using an aligned database of 23,847 nifH sequences. We found that there are 15 universal nifH primers that target 90% or more of nitrogen fixers, but that there are also 23 nifH primers that target less than 50% of nifH sequences. The nifH primers we evaluated vary in their phylogenetic bias and their ability to recover sequences from commonly sampled environments. In addition, many of these primers will amplify genes that do not mediate nitrogen fixation, and thus it would be advisable for researchers to screen their sequencing results for the presence of non-target genes before analysis. Universal primers that performed well in silico were tested empirically with soil samples and with genomic DNA from a phylogenetically diverse set of nitrogen-fixing strains.
