Indeed, the percent GC content of a prokaryotic genome is considered a characteristic of the organism, and closely-related organisms often have similar GC contents. Even at the phylum level of the taxnomic hierarchy for prokaryotes, organisms may share a similar range of GC contents. For example, Actinobacteria are sometimes referred to as the high GC gram positives while Firmicutes are referred to as the low GC gram positives.

Closely-related organisms tend to have similar GC%. For example, Actinobacteria are high GC%, gram positive organisms whose median GC% was determined to be 70% herein, while the Firmicutes are low GC%, gram postitive organisms whose median GC% was 40% herein. Based upon the current genome representation in this dataset, some phyla like the the Tenericutes have a narrow distribution of GC% whereas others like the Firmicutes have a wide range.

In this blogpost, I will take the previously determined genome sizes and multiply them against the molecular weight of a DNA base pair to arrive at the mass of a prokaryotic genome. I start by examining the structural components of DNA (the 4 nitrogenous bases, a pentose sugar called deoxyribose, and phosphate) and their elemental composition, and then I will determine the amount of mass variation that could result from natural variation in genome GC content.\n Load Packages Let’s load the packages that we’ll use in this blogpost up front so that we don’t have to search the code snippets in order to find the dependencies. There are 2 packages that we’ll use:\nTidyverse for importing data into a Tibble object PeriodicTable, which includes a function for retrieving the atomic masses of the elements  library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.3.3 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(PeriodicTable)  Determining the Number of Atoms of Each Element in a DNA Base Pair DNA is a macromolecule that consists of a sequence of chemically linked nucleotides. Nucleotides are comprised of a nucleoside linked to a phosphate. Nucleosides consist of a nitrogenous base such as a purine (A or G) or a pyrimidine (T or C) linked to a sugar, which in the case of DNA is the pentose sugar deoxyribose. Hence, there are 3 components of DNA:\nPhosphate Pentose sugar deoxyribose Nitrogenous bases Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine  Whereas each nucleotide in DNA contains phosphate and deoxyribose, the nitrogenous base will vary. Indeed, it this variation in the sequence of nitrogenous bases along the length of a genome that determines the information content of the macromolecule and ultimately the identity of the organism.\nLet’s take a closer look at the 3 components of DNA by examining their molecular structure, determining the number of atoms of each element in their structure, and then calculating their molecular mass.\nThe Phosphate Phosphate is the simplest of the 3 DNA components, consting of 1 phosphorus atom and 4 oxygen atoms:\nThe structure of a lone phosphate molecule.\n This view of a phosphate molecule was generated using Jmol from an sdf format file representing the structure of PO4. The sdf file was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Databank webpage for PO4.\nThe colors in the molecular structures presented in this blogpost correspond to the CPK (Corey, Pauling, Koltun) color scheme:\ncarbon is grey\nhydrogen is white\noxygen is red\nnitrogen is blue\nphosphorus is orange\n The Pentose Sugar Deoxyribose The pentose sugar deoxyribose, along with phosphate, form the backbone of DNA by linking the nucleotides. In DNA, deoxyribose forms a furanose ring as in this view of the structure of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose:\n.\nI downloaded the sdf format file for the chemical structure of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose from PubChem in order to produce the above molecular structure image within Jmol.\nThe chemical formula for beta-D-2-Deoxyribose at PubChem is C5H10O4.\nI will now calculate the molecular mass of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose. For reference, these are the atomic masses of the elements in DNA:\n  Element Atomic Mass    C 12.0107  O 15.9994  N 14.0067  P 30.9738  H 1.0079    The mass of each element is conveniently accessible via the mass() function in the R package PeriodicTable.\n# Create the data frame based on the formula for deoxyribose. deoxyribose.df1\u0026lt;- data.frame(element = c(\u0026quot;C\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;O\u0026quot;), freq = c(5,10,4)) # Add a 3rd column that is the atomic mass of each element. deoxyribose.df2 \u0026lt;- cbind(deoxyribose.df1, MW = PeriodicTable::mass(deoxyribose.df1[1:nrow(deoxyribose.df1),1])) # Add a 4th column that is the total molecular weight of each element # in the deoxyribose molecule. This is the product of the atomic # mass and the number of atoms of each element. deoxyribose.df3 \u0026lt;- cbind(deoxyribose.df2, MW.tot = deoxyribose.df2[,2] * deoxyribose.df2[,3]) deoxyribose.df3 ## element freq MW MW.tot ## 1 C 5 12.01070 60.0535 ## 2 H 10 1.00794 10.0794 ## 3 O 4 15.99940 63.9976 sum(deoxyribose.df3[,\u0026quot;MW.tot\u0026quot;]) ## [1] 134.1305 The molecular weight of deoxyribose is determined to be 134.1305 g/mol, which matches the molecular weight for beta-D-2-Deoxyribose at PubChem.\n The Nitrogenous Bases I’ll obtain the number of C, N, O, and H atoms in each nitrogenous base by using a column from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) files for the molecular model of each base. The PDB files for each nitrogenous base were obtained from the “required case study files” for an online DNA case study written by Leonardo Trabuco and Elizabeth Villa.\nAdenine The molecular structure of adenine.\n I will obtain the number of atoms of each element in the adenine structure by parsing its PDB file.\n# Read the adenine PDB file into a tibble, skipping the first row # that causes the column of interest to be missed. adenine \u0026lt;- read_table2(file = \u0026quot;../../static/files/adenine.pdb\u0026quot;, col_names = FALSE, skip = 1) # Remove the last row that only contains \u0026quot;end\u0026quot;.

To do this, I will need the atomic mass of each element:\n# Change to a data frame. A.df \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(A.table) # Add a 3rd column that is the atomic mass of each element. A.df2 \u0026lt;- cbind(A.df, MW = PeriodicTable::mass(A.df[1:nrow(A.df),1])) # Add a 4th column that is the total molecular weight of each element # in the nucleotide base molecule.

In double stranded DNA there is complementarity between strands whereby A forms a linkage with T that consists of 2 hydrogen bonds, whereas G forms a linkage with C that consists of 3 hydrogen bonds. The AT and GC base pairing is illustrated in the following molecular structure images:\nAn AT base pair.\n A GC base pair.\n An AT and a GC base pair shown together.\n These images of DNA base pairs were obtained online from MolviZ.Org on the DNA Structure page by Eric Martz and Angel Herráez, wherein their Nucleotide Pairing model is particularly useful for illustrating the basic principles of DNA molecular composition and geometry.\n The Weight of an AT vs. a GC Base Pair We can see from the images and calculations above that the 4 nitrogenous bases vary in molecular structure and in the number of atoms of each element that comprise them, and hence there are differences in the molar mass of each nitrogenous base.\nNow let’s examine the molar mass of an AT and a GC base pair to determine whether they may have substantially different masses. Here I’ll use the PDB file for a GC base pair to extract the number of atoms of each element in the same manner as for calculating the molar mass of the nitrogenous bases.\n# Read the CG base pair PDB file into a tibble.

This is equivalent to a difference of 0.16%, or less than one fifth of one percent between the base pairs, a negligible amount.\nA rule of thumb is that the average weight of a DNA base pair is 650 daltons. A dalton weighs 1.66054 x10-24 g, and so 650 daltons weigh 1.079351 zg. According to this rule, the 4.64 Mb genome of E. coli K12 would weigh 4.64 x106 bp X 1.0794 x10-21 g/bp = 5.0081891 fg.\nIn my previous blogpost on prokaryotic genome size, I determined the median prokaryotic genome size was 4.050955 Mbp, whereas the smallest was 0.185014 Mbp and the largest was 16.0407 Mbp.\nLet’s start with calculating the mass of the median genome:\n\\[4.050955 \\times 10^{6} bp * \\frac{650 Da}{bp} * \\frac{1.66054 \\times 10^{-24} g}{1 Da} * \\frac{1\\times10^{15}fg}{1 g} \\]\n= 4.3724023 fg weight of the median genome size.\nUsing the above formula, the largest genome weighs 17.3135456 fg while the smallest genome weighs 0.199695 fg.\nNote that the 650 dalton rule of thumb is described as the mass of one DNA base pair as a sodium salt. However, the value that I obtained is for the mass of a DNA base pair is 618 daltons, a discrepancy of 32 daltons. A sodium atom weighs ~23 daltons, and so even then there are about 9 daltons that remain unaccounted, and the source of this discrepancy should be identified.\nAlso note that on the Thermo Fisher website for DNA and RNA Molecular Weights and Conversions, under the heading “Nucleic Acid Molecular Weight Conversions” and subheading “Approximate M.W.’s of Nucleic Acids”, the folowing approximation is listed, which also deviates from my result of 618 daltons for the weight of a DNA base pair:\n M.W. of dsDNA = (# nucleotides x 607.4) + 157.9\n  Conclusion The structure and composition of the 4 nitrogenous bases of DNA (A, T, G, and C) vary as does their molecular weight which ranges from 111.1 daltons for cytosine to 151.13 daltons for guanine. However, in double-stranded DNA, due to the formation of AT and GC base pairs, the difference in molecular weight of the individual bases is offset such that there is less than one fifth of one percent difference in the molecular weight of an AT base pair (617.3997 Da) vs. a GC base pair (618.3878 Da). Hence, differences in prokaryotic genome mass due to GC content variation would be negligible, and sequence length is the most influential factor determining the mass of prokaryotic genomes, which vary from 0.199695 fg for the smallest genome to 17.313546 fg for the largest, with a median mass of 4.372402 fg.\nIn the next blogpost, I will extrapolate from the mass of a single prokaryotic genome to the mass of prokaryotic community DNA to be expected from the typical amounts of sample material used in DNA extractions.\n Additional Resources A summary of useful DNA facts and figures is presented in IDT’s Molecular Facts and Figures pdf.\n ","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600703070,"objectID":"77fb79de5fe6cdf819cf8808d37deee1","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-weight/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/prokaryotic-genome-weight/","section":"post","summary":"In this blogpost, I describe the calculation of prokaryotic genome weight and determine genome mass variation due to GC content variation to be negligible in double stranded genomes.","tags":["genome weight","genomics","DNA molecular weight"],"title":"Prokaryotic Genome Weight","type":"post"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby"],"categories":["genome calculations"],"content":" Introduction Prokaryotic genomes encompass a range of sizes whereby larger genomes may encode more genes that allow for the organism to respond to their environment and smaller, streamlined genomes may indicate adaptation to a less varying, host environment.

The largest genome among the refseq genomes belongs to Minicystis rosea whereas the smallest genome belongs to Metaprevotella massiliensis. It is notable that the smallest genome is classified as a Scaffold and thus may not be accurate.\nLet’s also take a look at the distribution:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table, x = `Size(Mb)`, binwidth = 1) Let’s see how many genomes are available for each phylum in this dataset:\nlibrary(tidyr) # Split the Organism Groups column into new columns named according to their respective taxonomy level prokaryote.genomes.table.split \u0026lt;- separate(data=prokaryote.genomes.table, col = `Organism Groups`, sep = \u0026quot;;\u0026quot;, into = c(\u0026quot;Domain\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Phylum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Class\u0026quot;)) summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) ## Acidobacteria Aquificae ## 29 21 ## Bacteria incertae sedis Caldiserica/Cryosericota group ## 4 1 ## Calditrichaeota Chrysiogenetes ## 1 2 ## Coprothermobacterota Deferribacteres ## 2 8 ## Dictyoglomi Elusimicrobia ## 2 2 ## Euryarchaeota FCB group ## 346 1329 ## Fusobacteria Nitrospinae/Tectomicrobia group ## 38 1 ## Nitrospirae Proteobacteria ## 10 4592 ## PVC group Spirochaetes ## 98 141 ## Synergistetes TACK group ## 19 62 ## Terrabacteria group Thermodesulfobacteria ## 4950 12 ## Thermotogae ## 40 It looks like there are only a few phyla that have enough genomes to make a reliable histogram, so lets create a new dataset with only those phyla having \u0026gt; 90 genomes.\nLet’s break the distribution down into separate density plots for each of the 6 phyla with over 90 genomes:\nlibrary(ggplot2) phyla.subset.names \u0026lt;- names(which(summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) \u0026gt; 90)) prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced \u0026lt;- prokaryote.genomes.table.split[prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[1] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[2] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[3] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[4] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[5] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[6],] qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, alpha = I(0.2)) We can see that there is considerable variation in the genome size distribution for each phylum. Let’s get a clearer view by using facets to separate out each phylum:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, facets = Phylum ~ .) Based upon the separated density plots, it looks as if the genome size varies by phylum. Let’s see how much mean genome size varies by phylum:\nEuryarchaeota = 3.1622121 FCB group = 4.4686722 Proteobacteria = 4.4354607 PVC group = 5.271497 Spirochaetes = 3.3388135 Terrabacteria group = 4.4780869  Thus, it appears that phylum-dependent, mean genome size ranges from 3.2 to 5.3 Mb.\n Genome Size Positively Correlates with Number of Coding Sequences The prokaryotic genomes table from NCBI also indicates the number of coding sequences (CDS) in each genome. By creating a scatterplot of genome size vs. CDS, we may examine the relationship between genome size and number of CDS.\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Domain, alpha = I(0.2)) Genome size is strongly and positively correlated with the number of CDS in the genome; put another way, larger genomes have more genes. There are outliers, though, and while those with zero CDS values may be attributable to missing CDS annotation, those with higher than expected CDS should be further explored. Archaea appear to follow a trend similar to Bacteria.\nLet’s check to see if the outliers are associated with a single finishing level:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Level, alpha = I(0.4)) It appears that the outliers with zero CDS are mixed, but most of those with abnormally high CDS for their genome size are labeled as “Chromosome”. In further work, the taxonomic identity of these outliers may be explored.\n Conclusion The genome sizes in this set of 11710 RefSeq representative prokaryotes vary by phylum and span nearly two orders of magnitude from the smallest at 0.185014 Mb to the largest at 16.0407 Mb. The median genome size was determined to be 4.050955 Mb and is a useful approximation that may be used to estimate, for instance, the number of genome equivalents in a given quantity of DNA, or in determining the number of genome equivalents required by a sequencing library preparation, or in determining the number of genome equivalents in the output of a DNA sequencing run.\nThis webpage was composed using R Markdown, and the Rmd file is available for download and may be viewed as a plain text file or by opening the file within RStudio.\n ","date":1598832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"2f7a1962561035c3841b1ca86b6b16ca","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","section":"post","summary":"In this blogpost, I examine genome size among the 11,710 RefSeq representative prokaryotic genomes.","tags":["genomics","genome size","refseq","CDS"],"title":"Prokaryotic Genome Size","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shahid Nadeem","Lars R.

Some field experiments have shown the opposite effect, however, and the reason for this could be that liming stimulates nitrification-driven N2O production by enhancing nitrification rates, and by favoring ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) over ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). AOB produce more N2O than AOA, and high nitrification rates induce transient/local hypoxia, thereby stimulating heterotrophic denitrification. To study these phenomena, we investigated nitrification and denitrification kinetics and the abundance of AOB and AOA in soils sampled from a field experiment 2–3 years after liming. The field trial compared traditional liming (carbonates) with powdered siliceous rocks. As expected, the N2O/(N2O + N2) product ratio of heterotrophic denitrification declined with increasing pH, and the potential nitrification rate and its N2O yield (YN2O: N2O-N/NO3–-N), as measured in fully oxic soil slurries, increased with pH, and both correlated strongly with the AOB/AOA gene abundance ratio. Soil microcosm experiments were monitored for nitrification, its O2-consumption and N2O emissions, as induced by ammonium fertilization. Here we observed a conspicuous dependency on water filled pore space (WFPS): at 60 and 70% WFPS, YN2O was 0.03-0.06% and 0.06–0.15%, respectively, increasing with increasing pH, as in the aerobic soil slurries. At 85% WFPS, however, YN2O was more than two orders of magnitude higher, and decreased with increasing pH. A plausible interpretation is that O2 consumption by fertilizer-induced nitrification cause hypoxia in wet soils, hence induce heterotrophic nitrification, whose YN2O decline with increasing pH. We conclude that while low emissions from nitrification in well-drained soils may be enhanced by liming, the spikes of high N2O emission induced by ammonium fertilization at high soil moisture may be reduced by liming, because the heterotrophic N2O reduction is enhanced by high pH.","tags":["N2O","N2O-reductase","moisture","nitrification","soil pH","liming","rock powder","ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)","ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA)"],"title":"Contingent Effects of Liming on N2O-Emissions Driven by Autotrophic Nitrification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leidy Lagos","Sabina Leanti La Rosa","Magnus Arntzen","Ragnhild Ånestad","Nicolas Terrapon","John Christian Gaby","Bjørge Westereng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616292180,"objectID":"b8cba7b2fd1aa08206f54c6aac01db3d","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/lagos-2020/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T01:46:16.322777Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lagos-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The secretion of extracellular vesicles, EVs, is a common process in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells for intercellular communication, survival, and pathogenesis. Previous studies have illustrated the presence of EVs in supernatants from pure cultures of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative glycan-degrading gut commensals. However, the isolation and characterization of EVs secreted by a complex microbial community have not been clearly reported. In a recent paper, we showed that wood-derived, complex $β$-mannan, which shares a structural similarity with conventional dietary fibers, can be used to modulate the porcine gut microbiota composition and activity. In this paper, we investigated the production, size, composition, and proteome of EVs secreted by pig fecal microbiota after 24 h enrichment on complex $β$-mannan. Using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we identified EVs with an average size of 165 nm. We utilized mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic profiling of EV proteins against a database of 355 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the porcine colon and thereby identified 303 proteins. For EVs isolated from the culture grown on $β$-mannan, most proteins mapped to two MAGs, MAG53 and MAG272, belonging to the orders Clostridiales and Bacilli, respectively. Furthermore, the MAG with the third-most-detected protein was MAG 343, belonging to the order Enterobacteriales. The most abundant proteins detected in the $β$-mannan EVs proteome were involved in translation, energy production, amino acid, and carbohydrate transport, as well as metabolism. Overall, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the successful isolation of EVs released from a complex microbial community; furthermore, the protein content of the EVs reflects the response of specific microbes to the available carbohydrate source.","tags":["Beta-mannan","Extracellular vesicles","In vitro","Microbiota","Proteome"],"title":"Isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles secreted in vitro by porcine microbiota","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leszek Michalak","John Christian Gaby","Leidy Lagos","Sabina Leanti La Rosa","Torgeir R.

Biological biogas upgrading may serve as a low-cost approach because it can be easily integrated with existing facilities at biogas plants. The microbial communities found in anaerobic digesters typically contain hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which can use hydrogen (H 2) as a reducing agent for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into methane (CH 4). Thus, biological biogas upgrading through the exogenous addition of H 2 into biogas digesters for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 can increase CH 4 yield and lower CO 2 emission. Results: The addition of 4 mol of H 2 per mol of CO 2 was optimal for batch biogas reactors and increased the CH 4 content of the biogas from 67 to 94%. The CO 2 content of the biogas was reduced from 33 to 3% and the average residual H 2 content was 3%. At molar H 2 :CO 2 ratios  4:1, all CO 2 was converted into CH 4 , but the pH increased above 8 due to depletion of CO 2 , which negatively influenced the process stability. Additionally, high residual H 2 content in these reactors was unfavourable, causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and reduced CH 4 yields. The reactor microbial communities shifted in composition over time, which corresponded to changes in the reactor variables. Numerous taxa responded to the H 2 inputs, and in particular the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium increased in abundance with addition of H 2. In addition, the apparent rapid response of hydrogenotrophic methano-gens to intermittent H 2 feeding indicates the suitability of biological methanation for variable H 2 inputs, aligning well with fluctuations in renewable electricity production that may be used to produce H 2. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that the H 2 :CO 2 ratio has a significant effect on reactor performance during in situ biological methanation. Consequently, the H 2 :CO 2 molar ratio should be kept at 4:1 to avoid process instability. A shift toward hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was indicated by an increase in the abundance of the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium.","tags":["biological biogas upgrading","16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis","anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis","Methanobacterium"],"title":"Effects of H2 : CO2 ratio and H2 supply fluctuation on methane content and microbial community composition during in-situ biological biogas upgrading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smruthi Karthikeyan","Luis M.

We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Slackia, Clostridium XI and Faecalibacterium. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue vs. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included Slackia, Roseburia, unclass. Ruminococcaeceae, unclass. Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter. Colorectal tumors are rarely diagnosed in dogs, but despite this limitation, we were able to show that dogs with colorectal tumors have distinct fecal microbiota profiles. These initial results support the need for future case-control studies that are adequately powered, as well as age-matched and breed-matched, in order to evaluate the influence of bacteria on colorectal cancer etiopathogenesis and to determine whether the bacteria may have potential as biomarkers in clinical settings.","tags":["animal microbiome","microbial community analysis","canine microbiome","dog microbiome","fecal microbiome","intestinal microbiome","gut microbiome","colorectal cancer","medical microbiology","diseases","16S","SSU rRNA"],"title":"Characterization of the fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Lavanya Rishishwar","Lina C.

A large number of PCR primer sets have been developed for nifH amplification, and the effective deployment of these approaches should be guided by a rapid, easy-to-use analysis protocol. Bioinformatic analysis of marker gene sequences also requires considerable expertise. In this study, we advance the state of the art for nifH analysis by evaluating nifH primer set performance, developing an improved amplicon sequencing workflow, and implementing a user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline. The developed amplicon sequencing workflow is a three-stage PCR-based approach that uses established technologies for incorporating sample-specific barcode sequences and sequencing adapters. Based on our primer evaluation, we recommend the Ando primer set be used with a modified annealing temperature of 58°C, as this approach captured the largest diversity of nifH templates, including paralog cluster IV/V sequences. To improve nifH sequence analysis, we developed a computational pipeline which infers taxonomy and optionally filters out paralog sequences. In addition, we employed an empirical model to derive optimal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs for the nifH gene at the species, genus, and family levels. A comprehensive workflow script named TaxADivA (TAXonomy Assignment and DIVersity Assessment) is provided to ease processing and analysis of nifH amplicons. Our approach is then validated through characterization of diazotroph communities across environmental gradients in beach sands impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in a peat moss-dominated wetland, and in various plant compartments of a sugarcane field.IMPORTANCE Nitrogen availability often limits ecosystem productivity, and nitrogen fixation, exclusive to prokaryotes, comprises a major source of nitrogen input that sustains food webs. The nifH gene, which codes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme, is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in nature. In this study, a flexible sequencing/analysis pipeline, named TaxADivA, was developed for nifH amplicons produced by Illumina paired-end sequencing, and it enables an inference of taxonomy, performs clustering, and produces output in formats that may be used by programs that facilitate data exploration and analysis. Diazotroph diversity and community composition are linked to ecosystem functioning, and our results advance the phylogenetic characterization of diazotroph communities by providing empirically derived nifH similarity cutoffs for species, genus, and family levels. The utility of our pipeline is validated for diazotroph communities in a variety of ecosystems, including contaminated beach sands, peatland ecosystems, living plant tissues, and rhizosphere soil.","tags":["nifH","bioinformatics","TaxADivA","next-generation sequencing","nitrogen fixation","diazotrophs","amplicon sequencing","amplicon sequence analysis","nifH paralogs","oil contaminated beach sands","Deepwater Horizon","Macondo oil well","Gulf of Mexico oil spill","sugarcane","plant microbiome","Saccharum officinarum","peatlands","peat bog","Sphagnum","rhizosphere","soil"],"title":"Diazotroph community characterization via a highthroughput nifH amplicon sequencing and analysis pipeline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kine Svensson","Lisa Paruch","John Christian Gaby","Roar Linjordet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"b1917dd436665a8f9bd629cd1c30fedd","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/svensson-2018/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.247861Z","relpermalink":"/publication/svensson-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In anaerobic digestion, studies of feeding frequency have produced conflicting results. Hence, the effect of feeding frequency on process variables and microbial community structure was investigated by comparing a laboratory-scale digester fed steam exploded food waste 10 times daily vs. one fed an equivalent amount once daily. The Frequently Fed Digester (FFD) produced on average 20% more methane and had lower effluent concentrations of long-chain fatty acids. Greater daily fluctuations in acetate, pH and biogas production rate could explain the lower specific methane yield and β-oxidation. Feeding frequency also influenced the microbial community whereby Tenericutes (42%) dominated in FFD but Firmicutes (31%) was most abundant in the Daily Fed Digester (DFD). Feeding frequency effects are therefore postulated to occur more often in digesters fed labile feedstocks at high organic loading rates.","tags":["16S","SSU rRNA","anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","CSTR","feeding frequency"],"title":"Feeding frequency influences process performance and microbial community composition in anaerobic digesters treating steam exploded food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Greses","John Christian Gaby","Daniel Aguado","José Ferrer","Aurora Seco","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"0e2c8aa8d6ff3a9d608e66dab3e95db7","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/greses-2017/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.246879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/greses-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Microbial communities were thoroughly characterized in a mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), which were both treating recalcitrant microalgal biomass dominated by Scenedesmus. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis was performed when the AnMBR achieved 70% algal biodegradation and revealed high microbial diversity, probably due to the high solid retention time (SRT) of the AnMBR configuration. The bacterial community consisted of Chloroflexi (27.9%), WWE1 (19.0%) and Proteobacteria (15.4%) as the major phyla, followed by Spirochaetes (7.7%), Bacteroidetes (5.9%) and Firmicutes (3.6%). These phyla are known to exhibit proteolytic and cellulolytic capabilities required to degrade the Scenedesmus cell-wall. Methanosaeta was the most abundant methanogen detected in the AnMBR suggesting that methane was mainly produced by the acetoclastic pathway. In comparison, the thermophilic CSTR achieved 32.6% algal biodegradation, and its bacterial community had fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (977 OTUs) than the AnMBR (1396 OTUs), as is generally observed for high temperature biogas reactors. However, phyla with high hydrolytic potential were detected such as Firmicutes (34.6%) and the candidate taxon EM3 (38.7%) in the thermophilic CSTR. Although the functional metabolism of EM3 in anaerobic digesters is unknown, the high abundance of EM3 suggests that this taxon plays an important role in the thermophilic, anaerobic degradation of Scenedesmus. The abundant syntrophic bacteria and the detection of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the thermophilic CSTR suggest that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was the dominant pathway for methane production in this reactor.","tags":["anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","membrane technology","microbial community analysis","Scenedesmus spp.","16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis"],"title":"Microbial community characterization during anaerobic digestion of Scenedesmus spp. under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa J.

The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum -dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 ) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) reduction and 15 N 2 incorporation. A molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria ( Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae ). Despite higher concentrations of dissolved vanadium ([V] 11 nM) than molybdenum ([Mo] 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing, and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water contents. Incorporation of 15 N 2 was suppressed 90% by O 2 and 55% by C 2 H 2 and was unaffected by CH 4 and CO 2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C 2 H 2 -sensitive and C 2 H 2 -insensitive microbes that are more active at low concentrations of O 2 and show similar activity at high and low concentrations of CH 4 .","tags":["nitrogen fixation","diazotrophs","acetylene reduction assay","methanotrophs","Sphagnum","peatlands","peat bog","alternative nitrogenases","molybdenum nitrogenase","vanadium nitrogenase","Marcell Experimental Forest"],"title":"Molybdenum-based diazotrophy in a Sphagnum peatland in northern Minnesota","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.","tags":["amplification bias","quantification bias","degenerate primers","nifH","qPCR","nitrogenase","nitrogen fixation","diazotrophs"],"title":"The Use of Degenerate Primers in qPCR Analysis of Functional Genes Can Cause Dramatic Quantification Bias as Revealed by Investigation of nifH Primer Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Mirzaman Zamanzadeh","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"8eda47576df440e61182d37b7d69f448","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2017/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.246059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gaby-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis","anaerobic digestion","temperature-phased anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","microbial community analysis","retention time"],"title":"The effect of temperature and retention time on methane production and microbial community composition in staged anaerobic digesters fed with food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

Furthermore, we assess the range of habitats and geographic regions in which diazotrophic diversity has been assessed. We find that diazotrophs in many habitats remain under sampled. We also find that nifH cluster III, which includes obligate anaerobes, contains the greatest diversity of nifH sequences and that anoxic environments both contain the greatest diversity of diazotrophs and are the environments in which diazotrophic diversity is most poorly sampled.

The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages.

In particular, students of a foreign language may find a vocabulary list useful when preparing to read a literary work. A comprehensive vocabulary list can be quickly created from a plain text file on a computer by using a series of UNIX shell commands. The commands can even generate a list that is alphabetized and non-redundant.

Following the body of the literary work, there is a footer that contains the Project Gutenberg License. As the header and footer are extraneous to the literary work, the lines on which they occur will be identified in order to later remove them and leave only the text of Don Quijote.\nThe UNIX shell command cat, short for \u0026quot;concatenate\u0026quot;, reads the contents of a file and outputs them, and as its name implies may be used to concatenate multiple files. In our case, we will only use it to read and output our text file. The UNIX shell command head displays a set number of lines from the beginning, or \u0026quot;head\u0026quot;, of a file, whereas the command tail does the same, but at the end, or \u0026quot;tail\u0026quot;, of a file. The pipe character | takes the output of a command and uses it as input for the subsequent command, enabling a chain of commands to perform operations on a single data source without having to save and reload the new version of the data that results from each command.\nThe -n parameter of the head and tail commands specifies the number of lines to output, and one has to progressively increase the number of lines until one can see that the entirety of the header or footer is displayed, then note the line numbers where the beginning and end of the literary text occur.\n# Find the header. cat CervantesDonQuijote.txt --number | head -n 50 # Find the footer. cat CervantesDonQuijote.txt --number | tail -n 400  ## 1 ﻿The Project Gutenberg eBook of Don Quijote, by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ## 2 ## 3 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and ## 4 most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions ## 5 whatsoever.

Hart was the originator of the Project ## 38043 Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be ## 38044 freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and ## 38045 distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of ## 38046 volunteer support. ## 38047 ## 38048 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed ## 38049 editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in ## 38050 the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not ## 38051 necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper ## 38052 edition. ## 38053 ## 38054 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search ## 38055 facility: www.gutenberg.org ## 38056 ## 38057 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, ## 38058 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary ## 38059 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to ## 38060 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. ## 38061 ## 38062  Reading the line numbers that are displayed at the left of the output, the text of the book begins on line 29 and ends on line 37699.\n List Characters That Occur in the Text In processing the text to create the vocabulary list, we will need to delete punctuation, numbers, and other characters that are not letters of the alphabet that occur in the vocabulary words themselves. Otherwise, when punctuation occurs adjacent to a word, then we could end up with multiple occurrences of the word, differing by the adjacent puctuation, in our vocabulary list, such as occurs in the following:\nabajo\nabajo,\nabajo;\nabajo.\nwhereby we can see that 4 instances of the word \u0026quot;abajo\u0026quot; are created because of the attached punctuation characters. Hence, punctuation should be eliminated from the text in order to create a non-redundant vocabulary list.\nThe following piped commands will list the unique characters in the text after standard punctuation has been deleted. The pipe begins with the sed command, short for stream editor, which can edit text. In our case, we use it to simply read the text file and exclude the Project Gutenberg header and footer as explained earlier. Then, the tr command, short for translate as it may be used to replace one character with another, is used to delete punctuation characters in the \u0026quot;punctuation character class\u0026quot;, which is a pre-defined list of punctuation characters that is invoked with [:punct:]. The command grep, short for \u0026quot;global regular expression print\u0026quot;, allows searching for pattern matches. In our case, the -o parameter, which from the help for the command is said to \u0026quot;show only the part of a line matching PATTERN\u0026quot;, is combined with the REGEX wildcard \u0026quot;.\u0026quot;, which represents any character except the newline character. When used in this way the grep command effectively breaks the text up into one character on each line of the output, which is then sorted with the sort command into alphabetical order, and then the uniq command reduces the list to only the unique characters that appear in the text (minus the punctuation characters that were deleted by the tr -d '[:punct:]' command of course).\nsed -n '29,27699p' CervantesDonQuijote.txt | tr -d '[:punct:]' | grep -o . | sort | uniq  ## ## ¡ ## ¿ ## « ## » ## — ## ## 0 ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 5 ## 6 ## 7 ## a ## A ## á ## Á ## à ## b ## B ## c ## C ## d ## D ## e ## E ## é ## É ## f ## F ## g ## G ## h ## H ## i ## I ## í ## Í ## ï ## j ## J ## l ## L ## m ## M ## n ## N ## ñ ## Ñ ## o ## O ## ó ## Ó ## p ## P ## q ## Q ## r ## R ## s ## S ## t ## T ## u ## U ## ú ## Ú ## ü ## v ## V ## W ## x ## X ## y ## Y ## z ## Z At the top of the output, we can see 5 characters that are not included in the punctuation character class, and thus were not removed:\n¡ ¿ « » —\nWe'll need to specifically name these characters for deletion in order to make the vocabulary list.\n Create An Alphabetical Dictionary of Don Quijote Below, a piped series of commands creates an initial version of the non-redundant, alphabetized vocabulary list. It contains 10 commands:\nAs described above, the sed command reads the text file and outputs its contents while excluding the extraneous Project Gutenberg text by reading the file at the line right after the header ends and stopping at the line right before the footer begins. The tr command replaces the space character \u0026quot; \u0026quot; with newlines indicated by \\n, effectively separating each word onto its own line. The sed command is again invoked to remove the ¡ character, which is unique to the Spanish text and will not be removed by deleting the punctuation character class '[:punct:]' later in the pipe. For some reason that I do not know, but that I nevertheless discovered through trial and error, attempting to delete this character using the tr command results in misconversion of the á character throughout words in the list. The tr command is used to convert uppercase letters to lowercase, thus eliminating redundant occurrences of words due to capitalization of the first letter of the word at the beginning of sentences. Commands in UNIX are generally case-sensitive. The tr command is used to delete digits, or numbers throughout. The tr command is used to delete the punctuation characters «»—¿ that were identified as specific to this text and missed by the standard punctuation character class '[:punct:]'. The tr command is used to delete the standard punctuation character class. The tr command is used to delete occurrences of carriage returns with the escape sequence \\r. The sort command arranges te output alphabetically and at this point contains multiple occurrences of identical words. The uniq command reduces multiple occurrences of the same word to a single instance. Finally, the \u0026gt; indicates for the standard output to be re-directed to a file named CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt'. The\u0026gt;` will overwrite the file if it already exists but will create it if it doesn't already exist.  sed -n '29,37699p' CervantesDonQuijote.txt | tr \u0026quot; \u0026quot; \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot; | sed 's/¡//' | tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | tr -d '[:digit:]' | tr -d \u0026quot;«»—¿\u0026quot; | tr -d '[:punct:]' | tr -d '\\r' | sort | uniq \u0026gt; CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt   Examine the First and Last 10 Words in the List Let's use the head and tail commands to examine the first 10 and last 10 words in the list.\nhead CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt tail CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt  ## ## a ## á ## abad ## abadejo ## abades ## abadesa ## abaja ## abajan ## abajarse ## zoroástrica ## zorra ## zorras ## zorruna ## zuecos ## zulema ## zumban ## zurdo ## zurrón ## zuzaban This small sample of words in the list looks good. However, on deeper inspection of the list in a text editor, I identified the occurrence of Roman numerals, and these will need to be removed.\n Identify and Remove Roman Numerals Roman numerals consist of the characters \u0026quot;ivxlcm\u0026quot;, and they appear in our list because the characters used to denote them are also used in regular words. To remove Roman numerals, we'll need to find the lines in the vocabulary list that consist solely of the characters \u0026quot;ivxlcm\u0026quot;, and for this we'll use the grep command with a regular expression that specifies the word must begin with these characters, consist of one or more of the characters, and end with these characters. The following code produces a list of words consisting of the Roman numeral characters:\n# This also grabs real words like \u0026quot;mi\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mil\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;vi\u0026quot;, vil\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;civil\u0026quot;. grep \u0026quot;^[ivxlcm]*$\u0026quot; CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt  ## ## c ## civil ## i ## ii ## iii ## iv ## ix ## l ## li ## lii ## liii ## liv ## lix ## lv ## lvi ## lvii ## lviii ## lx ## lxi ## lxii ## lxiii ## lxiv ## lxix ## lxv ## lxvi ## lxvii ## lxviii ## lxx ## lxxi ## lxxii ## lxxiii ## lxxiv ## mi ## mil ## v ## vi ## vii ## viii ## vil ## x ## xi ## xii ## xiii ## xiv ## xix ## xl ## xli ## xlii ## xliii ## xliv ## xlix ## xlv ## xlvi ## xlvii ## xlviii ## xv ## xvi ## xvii ## xviii ## xx ## xxi ## xxii ## xxiii ## xxiv ## xxix ## xxv ## xxvi ## xxvii ## xxviii ## xxx ## xxxi ## xxxii ## xxxiii ## xxxiv ## xxxix ## xxxv ## xxxvi ## xxxvii ## xxxviii Upon review of this list, we can see that the real Spanish words \u0026quot;mi\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mil\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;vi\u0026quot;, vil\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;civil\u0026quot; are captured by this regular expression. To examine lines of the literary text where a particular word occurs, the following grep command may be used with the -n parameter, which prints the line number on the left before printing the content of the line where the match was found.\ngrep -n \u0026quot; vil \u0026quot; CervantesDonQuijote.txt  ## 15665:y de tan vil traje vestido. A lo cual el mozo, asiéndole fuertemente de las ## 16032:vuestro bajo y vil entendimiento que el cielo no os comunique el valor que ## 18984:aniquilarlas y ponerlas debajo de las más viles que de algún vil escudero The real Spanish words may be excluded from this grep command by using a \u0026quot;negative lookahead\u0026quot;, invoked with the ?! symbols. The -P parameter specifies to use the Perl form of regular expressions.\nLets see if the numbers add up; i.e. is the number of unique words in the first version of the text minus the number of roman numerals equal to the number of words remaining in the text once we have removed the roman numerals?\n# This command produces the number of unique words in the first version of the text. wc -l CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt # Include a \u0026quot;negative lookahead\u0026quot; in the regular expression that excludes real words from the Roman numeral characters # This command produces the number of occurrences of unique roman numerals in the text. grep -P '(?!^civil$|^mi$|^mil$|^vil$|^vi$)^[ivxlcm]*$' CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt | wc -l # This command produces the number of unique words remaining in the text once the unique roman numerals have been removed. grep -v -P '(?!^civil$|^mi$|^mil$|^vil$|^vi$)^[ivxlcm]*$' CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt | wc -l  ## 22974 CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt ## 75 ## 22899  Save the Vocabulary List Without Roman Numerals Now we'll save the final vocabulary list without the Roman numerals as the file CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordListNoRomanNumerals.txt. The grep command is used with the -v parameter, which outputs the inverse of the result. In our case, this will output all words in the first saved iteration of the vocabulary list except the Roman numerals.\ngrep -v -P '(?!^civil$|^mi$|^mil$|^vil$|^vi$)^[ivxlcm]*$' CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordList.txt \u0026gt; CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordListNoRomanNumerals.txt  How Many Unique Words Are in Don Quijote? Finally, we may now answer the question \u0026quot;How many unique words are in Don Quijote?\u0026quot; by using the wc command, short for \u0026quot;word count\u0026quot;, and specifying the -l parameter to count lines in the file. Since only one word appears on each line of the file, then the line count equals the word count.\nwc -l CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordListNoRomanNumerals.txt  ## 22899 CervantesDonQuijoteSpanishWordListNoRomanNumerals.txt There are 22899 unique words in Don Quijote.\n Summary We have taken the text of the literary work Don Quijote by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra and used a series of UNIX shell commands to process the text into a non-redundant, alphabetized vocabulary list.\n Future Work There are several possibilities for additional text mining using this literary work as a data source.\nOne possibility is to further reduce the vocabulary list into \u0026quot;lemmas\u0026quot;, which are the dictionary or reference form of words. For example, the words \u0026quot;catch\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;caught\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;catched\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;catching\u0026quot; are all forms of \u0026quot;catch\u0026quot;, and hence all occurrences of these words may be reduced to the single lemma \u0026quot;catch\u0026quot; that encompasses the general meaning of the four word forms.\nAnother possibility is to perform frequency analysis, whereby one may produce a list of the words that recur most often througout the book, and a word cloud may be used to create a visual representation of the highest frequency words.\nThe frequency of occurrence of multiple words, or word n-grams, may be analyzed rather than the frequency of single words alone. N-grams are a contiguous sequence of n words, where n is a number. A 2-gram, for example, is also called a bigram (e.g. \u0026quot;full moon\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;rainy day\u0026quot;) and a 3-gram is called a trigram (e.g. \u0026quot;simple but elegant\u0026quot;), and so on. There are a whole suite of concepts to refer to the various types of multi-word expressions (MWEs) including collocations, verbal idioms, frozen adverbials, partical verbs, complex nominals, etc. N-gram analysis and other more sophisticated analyses may be employed to extract MWEs, although a larger body of literary works may be needed in order to identify less common MWEs.\nFinally, if one already has a list of known vocabulary words, then one may remove the list of one's personal vocabulary from the vocabulary list derived from the literary work, therby leaving only the unknown or unfamiliar words to remain for study or memorization. Alternatively, the words in common between two literary works may be identified. As yet another example, the words found in a body of text but not present in a dictionary may identify slang or words otherwise missing from the dictionary. These tasks effectively involve set functions such the union, intersection, and complement.\nThese ideas may be explored in subsequent blog posts.\n   // add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables function bootstrapStylePandocTables() { $('tr.odd').parent('tbody').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed'); } $(document).ready(function () { bootstrapStylePandocTables(); });   $(document).ready(function () { window.buildTabsets(\"TOC\"); }); $(document).ready(function () { $('.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li').click(function () { $(this).parent().toggleClass('nav-tabs-open') }); });   (function () { var script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.src = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\"; document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script); })();    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"953a71c434dd52b12d7e5442289c2a8d","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/post/2021-07-04-unixpipesforforeignlanguagelearning/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-07-04-unixpipesforforeignlanguagelearning/","section":"post","summary":"Create a Word List        code{white-space: pre-wrap;} span.smallcaps{font-variant: small-caps;} span.underline{text-decoration: underline;} div.column{display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 50%;} div.hanging-indent{margin-left: 1.5em; text-indent: -1.5em;} ul.task-list{list-style: none;}  code{white-space: pre;} pre:not([class]) { background-color: white; }  if (window.hljs) { hljs.configure({languages: []}); hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); if (document.readyState \u0026\u0026 document.readyState === \"complete\") { window.setTimeout(function() { hljs.initHighlighting(); }, 0); } }  h1 { font-size: 34px; } h1.title { font-size: 38px; } h2 { font-size: 30px; } h3 { font-size: 24px; } h4 { font-size: 18px; } h5 { font-size: 16px; } h6 { font-size: 12px; } .","tags":null,"title":"","type":"post"}]
