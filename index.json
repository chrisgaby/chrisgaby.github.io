The largest genome among the refseq genomes belongs to Minicystis rosea whereas the smallest genome belongs to Metaprevotella massiliensis. It is notable that the smallest genome is classified as a Scaffold and thus may not be accurate.\nLet’s also take a look at the distribution:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table, x = `Size(Mb)`, binwidth = 1) Let’s see how many genomes are available for each phylum in this dataset:\nlibrary(tidyr) # Split the Organism Groups column into new columns named according to their respective taxonomy level prokaryote.genomes.table.split \u0026lt;- separate(data=prokaryote.genomes.table, col = `Organism Groups`, sep = \u0026quot;;\u0026quot;, into = c(\u0026quot;Domain\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Phylum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Class\u0026quot;)) summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) ## Acidobacteria Aquificae ## 29 21 ## Bacteria incertae sedis Caldiserica/Cryosericota group ## 4 1 ## Calditrichaeota Chrysiogenetes ## 1 2 ## Coprothermobacterota Deferribacteres ## 2 8 ## Dictyoglomi Elusimicrobia ## 2 2 ## Euryarchaeota FCB group ## 346 1329 ## Fusobacteria Nitrospinae/Tectomicrobia group ## 38 1 ## Nitrospirae Proteobacteria ## 10 4592 ## PVC group Spirochaetes ## 98 141 ## Synergistetes TACK group ## 19 62 ## Terrabacteria group Thermodesulfobacteria ## 4950 12 ## Thermotogae ## 40 It looks like there are only a few phyla that have enough genomes to make a reliable histogram, so lets create a new dataset with only those phyla having \u0026gt; 90 genomes.\nLet’s break the distribution down into separate density plots for each of the 6 phyla with over 90 genomes:\nlibrary(ggplot2) phyla.subset.names \u0026lt;- names(which(summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) \u0026gt; 90)) prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced \u0026lt;- prokaryote.genomes.table.split[prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[1] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[2] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[3] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[4] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[5] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[6],] qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, alpha = I(0.2)) We can see that there is considerable variation in the genome size distribution for each phylum. Let’s get a clearer view by using facets to separate out each phylum:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, facets = Phylum ~ .) Based upon the separated density plots, it looks as if the genome size varies by phylum. Let’s see how much it varies by phylum:\nEuryarchaeota = 3.1622121 FCB group = 4.4686722 Proteobacteria = 4.4354607 PVC group = 5.271497 Spirochaetes = 3.3388135 Terrabacteria group = 4.4780869  Thus, it appears that phylum-dependent genome size variation ranges from 3.2 to 5.3 Mb.\n Genome Size Positively Correlates with Number of Coding Sequences library(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Domain, alpha = I(0.2)) Genome size is strongly and positively correlated with the number of Coding Sequences (CDS) in the genome; put another way, larger genomes have more genes. There are outliers, though, and while those with zero CDS values may be attributable to missing CDS annotation, those with higher than expected CDS should be further explored. Archaea appear to follow a trend similar to Bacteria.\nLet’s check to see if the outliers are associated with a single finishing level:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Level, alpha = I(0.4)) It appears that the outliers with zero CDS are mixed, but most of those with abnormally high CDS for their genome size are labeled as “Chromosome”. In further work, the taxonomic identity of these outliers may be explored.\n Conclusion The genome sizes in this set of 11710 RefSeq representative prokaryotes vary by phylum and span nearly two orders of magnitude from the smallest at 0.185014 Mb to the largest at 16.0407 Mb. The median genome size was determined to be 4.050955 megabases and is a useful approximation that may be used to estimate, for instance, the number of genome equivalents in a given quantity of DNA, or in determining the number of genome equivalents required by a sequencing library preparation, or in determining the number of genome equivalents in the output of a DNA sequencing run.\n ","date":1598832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598880090,"objectID":"2f7a1962561035c3841b1ca86b6b16ca","permalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","section":"post","summary":"In this blogpost, I examine genome size among the 11,710 RefSeq representative prokaryotic genomes.","tags":["genomics","genome size","refseq","CDS"],"title":"Prokaryotic Genome Size","type":"post"},{"authors":["Radziah Wahid","Daniel Girma Mulat","John Christian Gaby","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"9875017c4ef388845f5603e37f8cfd87","permalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/wahid-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T08:23:09.527258Z","relpermalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/wahid-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Commercial biogas upgrading facilities are expensive and consume energy. Biological biogas upgrading may serve as a low-cost approach because it can be easily integrated with existing facilities at biogas plants. The microbial communities found in anaerobic digesters typically contain hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which can use hydrogen (H 2) as a reducing agent for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into methane (CH 4). Thus, biological biogas upgrading through the exogenous addition of H 2 into biogas digesters for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 can increase CH 4 yield and lower CO 2 emission. Results: The addition of 4 mol of H 2 per mol of CO 2 was optimal for batch biogas reactors and increased the CH 4 content of the biogas from 67 to 94%. The CO 2 content of the biogas was reduced from 33 to 3% and the average residual H 2 content was 3%. At molar H 2 :CO 2 ratios textgreater 4:1, all CO 2 was converted into CH 4 , but the pH increased above 8 due to depletion of CO 2 , which negatively influenced the process stability. Additionally, high residual H 2 content in these reactors was unfavourable, causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and reduced CH 4 yields. The reactor microbial communities shifted in composition over time, which corresponded to changes in the reactor variables. Numerous taxa responded to the H 2 inputs, and in particular the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium increased in abundance with addition of H 2. In addition, the apparent rapid response of hydrogenotrophic methano-gens to intermittent H 2 feeding indicates the suitability of biological methanation for variable H 2 inputs, aligning well with fluctuations in renewable electricity production that may be used to produce H 2. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that the H 2 :CO 2 ratio has a significant effect on reactor performance during in situ biological methanation. Consequently, the H 2 :CO 2 molar ratio should be kept at 4:1 to avoid process instability. A shift toward hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was indicated by an increase in the abundance of the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium.","tags":["Biomethane","Glucose","Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis","In-situ","Mesophilic"],"title":"Effects of H2 : CO2 ratio and H2 supply fluctuation on methane content and microbial community composition during in-situ biological biogas upgrading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smruthi Karthikeyan","Luis M.

The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Slackia, Clostridium XI and Faecalibacterium. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue vs. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included Slackia, Roseburia, unclass. Ruminococcaeceae, unclass.

A large number of PCR primer sets have been developed for nifH amplification, and the effective deployment of these approaches should be guided by a rapid, easy-to-use analysis protocol. Bioinformatic analysis of marker gene sequences also requires considerable expertise. In this study, we advance the state of the art for nifH analysis by evaluating nifH primer set performance, developing an improved amplicon sequencing workflow, and implementing a user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline. The developed amplicon sequencing workflow is a three-stage PCR-based approach that uses established technologies for incorporating sample-specific barcode sequences and sequencing adapters. Based on our primer evaluation, we recommend the Ando primer set be used with a modified annealing temperature of 58°C, as this approach captured the largest diversity of nifH templates, including paralog cluster IV/V sequences. To improve nifH sequence analysis, we developed a computational pipeline which infers taxonomy and optionally filters out paralog sequences. In addition, we employed an empirical model to derive optimal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs for the nifH gene at the species, genus, and family levels. A comprehensive workflow script named TaxADivA (TAXonomy Assignment and DIVersity Assessment) is provided to ease processing and analysis of nifH amplicons. Our approach is then validated through characterization of diazotroph communities across environmental gradients in beach sands impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in a peat moss-dominated wetland, and in various plant compartments of a sugarcane field.IMPORTANCE Nitrogen availability often limits ecosystem productivity, and nitrogen fixation, exclusive to prokaryotes, comprises a major source of nitrogen input that sustains food webs. The nifH gene, which codes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme, is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in nature. In this study, a flexible sequencing/analysis pipeline, named TaxADivA, was developed for nifH amplicons produced by Illumina paired-end sequencing, and it enables an inference of taxonomy, performs clustering, and produces output in formats that may be used by programs that facilitate data exploration and analysis. Diazotroph diversity and community composition are linked to ecosystem functioning, and our results advance the phylogenetic characterization of diazotroph communities by providing empirically derived nifH similarity cutoffs for species, genus, and family levels.

Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water contents. Incorporation of 15 N 2 was suppressed 90% by O 2 and 55% by C 2 H 2 and was unaffected by CH 4 and CO 2 amendments.

We used a set of diverse, full-length nifH gene standards to test the performance of several universal nifH primer sets in qPCR. We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.","tags":["Amplification bias","Degenerate primers","nifH","qPCR"],"title":"The Use of Degenerate Primers in qPCR Analysis of Functional Genes Can Cause Dramatic Quantification Bias as Revealed by Investigation of nifH Primer Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Mirzaman Zamanzadeh","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"8eda47576df440e61182d37b7d69f448","permalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2017/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.221948Z","relpermalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Temperature-phased anaerobic digestion","Retention t","biogas","microbial community analysis","retention time","temperature-phased anaerobic digestion"],"title":"The effect of temperature and retention time on methane production and microbial community composition in staged anaerobic digesters fed with food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

All rights reserved. Diazotrophic microorganisms are taxonomically and metabolically diverse and they populate a wide variety of habitats. Diazotroph diversity is typically quantified through the analysis of nitrogenase nifH gene sequences recovered from environmental samples. In this chapter we review the global census of diazotrophic microorganisms as assessed by the diversity of nifH gene sequences in public sequence databases. We assess the diversity of diazotrophs found in different environments and taxonomic groupings and we also evaluate PCR primers and probes used to assess diazotroph diversity. Furthermore, we assess the range of habitats and geographic regions in which diazotrophic diversity has been assessed. We find that diazotrophs in many habitats remain under sampled. We also find that nifH cluster III, which includes obligate anaerobes, contains the greatest diversity of nifH sequences and that anoxic environments both contain the greatest diversity of diazotrophs and are the environments in which diazotrophic diversity is most poorly sampled. Our knowledge of diazotroph diversity is likely to expand dramatically as next-generation sequencing technologies are targeted towards surveys of the nifH gene.","tags":["Diversity","Ecology","NifH","Nitrogen fixation","Nitrogenase","PCR","Primers"],"title":"Assessment of Nitrogenase Diversity in the Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H Buckley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5e875659e5842701b660d7fbfb65fae5","permalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2014/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.224134Z","relpermalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe a nitrogenase gene sequence database that facilitates analysis of the evolution and ecology of nitrogen-fixing organisms. The database contains 32 954 aligned nitrogenase nifH sequences linked to phylogenetic trees and associated sequence metadata. The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having textless3% sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23% dissimilarity in nifH. The nifH database has a number of uses including phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, the design and assessment of primers/probes and the evaluation of nitrogenase sequence diversity.

Numerous PCR primers have been designed to amplify nifH, but a comprehensive evaluation of nifH PCR primers has not been performed. We performed an in silico analysis of the specificity and coverage of 51 universal and 35 group-specific nifH primers by using an aligned database of 23,847 nifH sequences. We found that there are 15 universal nifH primers that target 90% or more of nitrogen fixers, but that there are also 23 nifH primers that target less than 50% of nifH sequences. The nifH primers we evaluated vary in their phylogenetic bias and their ability to recover sequences from commonly sampled environments. In addition, many of these primers will amplify genes that do not mediate nitrogen fixation, and thus it would be advisable for researchers to screen their sequencing results for the presence of non-target genes before analysis. Universal primers that performed well in silico were tested empirically with soil samples and with genomic DNA from a phylogenetically diverse set of nitrogen-fixing strains. This analysis will be of great utility to those engaged in molecular analysis of nifH genes from isolates and environmental samples.","tags":null,"title":"A comprehensive evaluation of PCR primers to amplify the textlessitextgreaternifHtextless/itextgreater gene of nitrogenase.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H Buckley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1309478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1309478400,"objectID":"47c42bf85712b134bdd621cd53e35885","permalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2011/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T17:18:08.224505Z","relpermalink":"chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The global diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms was assessed through construction and analysis of an aligned database of 16,989 nifH sequences. We conclude that the diversity of diazotrophs is still poorly described and that many organisms remain to be discovered. Our analyses indicate that diversity is not distributed evenly across phylogenetic groups or across environments and that some of the most diverse assemblages and environments remain the most poorly characterized. The majority of OTUs were rare, falling in the long tail of the frequency distribution. The most dominant OTUs fell into either the Cyanobacteria or the $α$, $β$, and $γ$ Proteobacteria, and five of these dominant OTUs do not have any representatives cultivated in isolation. Soils contained the greatest diversity of nifH sequences of all of the environments surveyed. Cluster III, which is dominated by nifH sequences from obligate anaerobes, was found to contain the greatest diversity of all nifH lineages and is also the group for which diversity is the least sampled. Our findings provide context for ongoing efforts to explore diazotroph diversity, indicating specific groups and environments that remain poorly characterized.","tags":["Cluster Analysis","Cyanobacteria","Cyanobacteria: enzymology","Cyanobacteria: genetics","Databases","Environment","Gammaproteobacteria","Gammaproteobacteria: enzymology","Gammaproteobacteria: genetics","Genetic","Genetic Variation","Nitrogen Fixation","Oxidoreductases","Oxidoreductases: genetics","Phylogeny","Soil","Soil: analysis"],"title":"A global census of nitrogenase diversity.","type":"publication"}]
