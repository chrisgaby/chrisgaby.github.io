Indeed, the percent GC content of a prokaryotic genome is considered a characteristic of the organism, and closely-related organisms often have similar GC contents. Even at the phylum level of the taxnomic hierarchy for prokaryotes, organisms may share a similar range of GC contents. For example, Actinobacteria are sometimes referred to as the high GC gram positives while Firmicutes are referred to as the low GC gram positives.

Closely-related organisms tend to have similar GC%. For example, Actinobacteria are high GC%, gram positive organisms whose median GC% was determined to be 70% herein, while the Firmicutes are low GC%, gram postitive organisms whose median GC% was 40% herein. Based upon the current genome representation in this dataset, some phyla like the the Tenericutes have a narrow distribution of GC% whereas others like the Firmicutes have a wide range.

In this blogpost, I will take the previously determined genome sizes and multiply them against the molecular weight of a DNA base pair to arrive at the mass of a prokaryotic genome. I start by examining the structural components of DNA (the 4 nitrogenous bases, a pentose sugar called deoxyribose, and phosphate) and their elemental composition, and then I will determine the amount of mass variation that could result from natural variation in genome GC content.\n Load Packages Let’s load the packages that we’ll use in this blogpost up front so that we don’t have to search the code snippets in order to find the dependencies. There are 2 packages that we’ll use:\nTidyverse for importing data into a Tibble object PeriodicTable, which includes a function for retrieving the atomic masses of the elements  library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.3.3 ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(PeriodicTable)  Determining the Number of Atoms of Each Element in a DNA Base Pair DNA is a macromolecule that consists of a sequence of chemically linked nucleotides. Nucleotides are comprised of a nucleoside linked to a phosphate. Nucleosides consist of a nitrogenous base such as a purine (A or G) or a pyrimidine (T or C) linked to a sugar, which in the case of DNA is the pentose sugar deoxyribose. Hence, there are 3 components of DNA:\nPhosphate Pentose sugar deoxyribose Nitrogenous bases Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine  Whereas each nucleotide in DNA contains phosphate and deoxyribose, the nitrogenous base will vary. Indeed, it this variation in the sequence of nitrogenous bases along the length of a genome that determines the information content of the macromolecule and ultimately the identity of the organism.\nLet’s take a closer look at the 3 components of DNA by examining their molecular structure, determining the number of atoms of each element in their structure, and then calculating their molecular mass.\nThe Phosphate Phosphate is the simplest of the 3 DNA components, consting of 1 phosphorus atom and 4 oxygen atoms:\nThe structure of a lone phosphate molecule.\n This view of a phosphate molecule was generated using Jmol from an sdf format file representing the structure of PO4. The sdf file was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Databank webpage for PO4.\nThe colors in the molecular structures presented in this blogpost correspond to the CPK (Corey, Pauling, Koltun) color scheme:\ncarbon is grey\nhydrogen is white\noxygen is red\nnitrogen is blue\nphosphorus is orange\n The Pentose Sugar Deoxyribose The pentose sugar deoxyribose, along with phosphate, form the backbone of DNA by linking the nucleotides. In DNA, deoxyribose forms a furanose ring as in this view of the structure of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose:\n.\nI downloaded the sdf format file for the chemical structure of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose from PubChem in order to produce the above molecular structure image within Jmol.\nThe chemical formula for beta-D-2-Deoxyribose at PubChem is C5H10O4.\nI will now calculate the molecular mass of beta-D-2-Deoxyribose. For reference, these are the atomic masses of the elements in DNA:\n  Element Atomic Mass    C 12.0107  O 15.9994  N 14.0067  P 30.9738  H 1.0079    The mass of each element is conveniently accessible via the mass() function in the R package PeriodicTable.\n# Create the data frame based on the formula for deoxyribose. deoxyribose.df1\u0026lt;- data.frame(element = c(\u0026quot;C\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;O\u0026quot;), freq = c(5,10,4)) # Add a 3rd column that is the atomic mass of each element. deoxyribose.df2 \u0026lt;- cbind(deoxyribose.df1, MW = PeriodicTable::mass(deoxyribose.df1[1:nrow(deoxyribose.df1),1])) # Add a 4th column that is the total molecular weight of each element # in the deoxyribose molecule. This is the product of the atomic # mass and the number of atoms of each element. deoxyribose.df3 \u0026lt;- cbind(deoxyribose.df2, MW.tot = deoxyribose.df2[,2] * deoxyribose.df2[,3]) deoxyribose.df3 ## element freq MW MW.tot ## 1 C 5 12.01070 60.0535 ## 2 H 10 1.00794 10.0794 ## 3 O 4 15.99940 63.9976 sum(deoxyribose.df3[,\u0026quot;MW.tot\u0026quot;]) ## [1] 134.1305 The molecular weight of deoxyribose is determined to be 134.1305 g/mol, which matches the molecular weight for beta-D-2-Deoxyribose at PubChem.\n The Nitrogenous Bases I’ll obtain the number of C, N, O, and H atoms in each nitrogenous base by using a column from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) files for the molecular model of each base. The PDB files for each nitrogenous base were obtained from the “required case study files” for an online DNA case study written by Leonardo Trabuco and Elizabeth Villa.\nAdenine The molecular structure of adenine.\n I will obtain the number of atoms of each element in the adenine structure by parsing its PDB file.\n# Read the adenine PDB file into a tibble, skipping the first row # that causes the column of interest to be missed. adenine \u0026lt;- read_table2(file = \u0026quot;../../static/files/adenine.pdb\u0026quot;, col_names = FALSE, skip = 1) # Remove the last row that only contains \u0026quot;end\u0026quot;.

A.df2 \u0026lt;- cbind(A.df, MW = PeriodicTable::mass(A.df[1:nrow(A.df),1])) # Add a 4th column that is the total molecular weight of each element # in the nucleotide base molecule.

In double stranded DNA there is complementarity between strands whereby A forms a linkage with T that consists of 2 hydrogen bonds, whereas G forms a linkage with C that consists of 3 hydrogen bonds. The AT and GC base pairing is illustrated in the following molecular structure images:\nAn AT base pair.\n A GC base pair.\n An AT and a GC base pair shown together.\n These images of DNA base pairs were obtained online from MolviZ.Org on the DNA Structure page by Eric Martz and Angel Herráez, wherein their Nucleotide Pairing model is particularly useful for illustrating the basic principles of DNA molecular composition and geometry.\n The Weight of an AT vs. a GC Base Pair We can see from the images and calculations above that the 4 nitrogenous bases vary in molecular structure and in the number of atoms of each element that comprise them, and hence there are differences in the molar mass of each nitrogenous base.\nNow let’s examine the molar mass of an AT and a GC base pair to determine whether they may have substantially different masses. Here I’ll use the PDB file for a GC base pair to extract the number of atoms of each element in the same manner as for calculating the molar mass of the nitrogenous bases.\n# Read the CG base pair PDB file into a tibble.

This is equivalent to a difference of 0.16%, or less than one fifth of one percent between the base pairs, a negligible amount.\nA rule of thumb is that the average weight of a DNA base pair is 650 daltons. A dalton weighs 1.66054 x10-24 g, and so 650 daltons weigh 1.079351 zg. According to this rule, the 4.64 Mb genome of E. coli K12 would weigh 4.64 x106 bp X 1.0794 x10-21 g/bp = 5.0081891 fg.\nIn my previous blogpost on prokaryotic genome size, I determined the median prokaryotic genome size was 4.050955 Mbp, whereas the smallest was 0.185014 Mbp and the largest was 16.0407 Mbp.\nLet’s start with calculating the mass of the median genome:\n\\[4.050955 \\times 10^{6} bp * \\frac{650 Da}{bp} * \\frac{1.66054 \\times 10^{-24} g}{1 Da} * \\frac{1\\times10^{15}fg}{1 g} \\]\n= 4.3724023 fg weight of the median genome size.\nUsing the above formula, the largest genome weighs 17.3135456 fg while the smallest genome weighs 0.199695 fg.\nNote that the 650 dalton rule of thumb is described as the mass of one DNA base pair as a sodium salt. However, the value that I obtained is for the mass of a DNA base pair is 618 daltons, a discrepancy of 32 daltons. A sodium atom weighs ~23 daltons, and so even then there are about 9 daltons that remain unaccounted, and the source of this discrepancy should be identified.\nAlso note that on the Thermo Fisher website for DNA and RNA Molecular Weights and Conversions, under the heading “Nucleic Acid Molecular Weight Conversions” and subheading “Approximate M.W.’s of Nucleic Acids”, the folowing approximation is listed, which also deviates from my result of 618 daltons for the weight of a DNA base pair:\n M.W. of dsDNA = (# nucleotides x 607.4) + 157.9\n  Conclusion The structure and composition of the 4 nitrogenous bases of DNA (A, T, G, and C) vary as does their molecular weight which ranges from 111.1 daltons for cytosine to 151.13 daltons for guanine. However, in double-stranded DNA, due to the formation of AT and GC base pairs, the difference in molecular weight of the individual bases is offset such that there is less than one fifth of one percent difference in the molecular weight of an AT base pair (617.3997 Da) vs. a GC base pair (618.3878 Da). Hence, differences in prokaryotic genome mass due to GC content variation would be negligible, and sequence length is the most influential factor determining the mass of prokaryotic genomes, which vary from 0.199695 fg for the smallest genome to 17.313546 fg for the largest, with a median mass of 4.372402 fg.\nIn the next blogpost, I will extrapolate from the mass of a single prokaryotic genome to the mass of prokaryotic community DNA to be expected from the typical amounts of sample material used in DNA extractions.\n Additional Resources A summary of useful DNA facts and figures is presented in IDT’s Molecular Facts and Figures pdf.\n ","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600703070,"objectID":"77fb79de5fe6cdf819cf8808d37deee1","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-weight/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/prokaryotic-genome-weight/","section":"post","summary":"In this blogpost, I describe the calculation of prokaryotic genome weight and determine genome mass variation due to GC content variation to be negligible in double stranded genomes.","tags":["genome weight","genomics","DNA molecular weight"],"title":"Prokaryotic Genome Weight","type":"post"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby"],"categories":["genome calculations"],"content":" Introduction Prokaryotic genomes encompass a range of sizes whereby larger genomes may encode more genes that allow for the organism to respond to their environment and smaller, streamlined genomes may indicate adaptation to a less varying, host environment.

The largest genome among the refseq genomes belongs to Minicystis rosea whereas the smallest genome belongs to Metaprevotella massiliensis. It is notable that the smallest genome is classified as a Scaffold and thus may not be accurate.\nLet’s also take a look at the distribution:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table, x = `Size(Mb)`, binwidth = 1) Let’s see how many genomes are available for each phylum in this dataset:\nlibrary(tidyr) # Split the Organism Groups column into new columns named according to their respective taxonomy level prokaryote.genomes.table.split \u0026lt;- separate(data=prokaryote.genomes.table, col = `Organism Groups`, sep = \u0026quot;;\u0026quot;, into = c(\u0026quot;Domain\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Phylum\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Class\u0026quot;)) summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) ## Acidobacteria Aquificae ## 29 21 ## Bacteria incertae sedis Caldiserica/Cryosericota group ## 4 1 ## Calditrichaeota Chrysiogenetes ## 1 2 ## Coprothermobacterota Deferribacteres ## 2 8 ## Dictyoglomi Elusimicrobia ## 2 2 ## Euryarchaeota FCB group ## 346 1329 ## Fusobacteria Nitrospinae/Tectomicrobia group ## 38 1 ## Nitrospirae Proteobacteria ## 10 4592 ## PVC group Spirochaetes ## 98 141 ## Synergistetes TACK group ## 19 62 ## Terrabacteria group Thermodesulfobacteria ## 4950 12 ## Thermotogae ## 40 It looks like there are only a few phyla that have enough genomes to make a reliable histogram, so lets create a new dataset with only those phyla having \u0026gt; 90 genomes.\nLet’s break the distribution down into separate density plots for each of the 6 phyla with over 90 genomes:\nlibrary(ggplot2) phyla.subset.names \u0026lt;- names(which(summary(factor(prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum)) \u0026gt; 90)) prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced \u0026lt;- prokaryote.genomes.table.split[prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[1] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[2] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[3] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[4] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[5] | prokaryote.genomes.table.split$Phylum == phyla.subset.names[6],] qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, alpha = I(0.2)) We can see that there is considerable variation in the genome size distribution for each phylum. Let’s get a clearer view by using facets to separate out each phylum:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data=prokaryote.genomes.table.split.reduced, x = `Size(Mb)`, geom = \u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, color = Phylum, fill = Phylum, facets = Phylum ~ .) Based upon the separated density plots, it looks as if the genome size varies by phylum. Let’s see how much mean genome size varies by phylum:\nEuryarchaeota = 3.1622121 FCB group = 4.4686722 Proteobacteria = 4.4354607 PVC group = 5.271497 Spirochaetes = 3.3388135 Terrabacteria group = 4.4780869  Thus, it appears that phylum-dependent, mean genome size ranges from 3.2 to 5.3 Mb.\n Genome Size Positively Correlates with Number of Coding Sequences The prokaryotic genomes table from NCBI also indicates the number of coding sequences (CDS) in each genome. By creating a scatterplot of genome size vs. CDS, we may examine the relationship between genome size and number of CDS.\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Domain, alpha = I(0.2)) Genome size is strongly and positively correlated with the number of CDS in the genome; put another way, larger genomes have more genes. There are outliers, though, and while those with zero CDS values may be attributable to missing CDS annotation, those with higher than expected CDS should be further explored. Archaea appear to follow a trend similar to Bacteria.\nLet’s check to see if the outliers are associated with a single finishing level:\nlibrary(ggplot2) qplot(data = prokaryote.genomes.table.split, x = `Size(Mb)`, y = CDS, color = Level, alpha = I(0.4)) It appears that the outliers with zero CDS are mixed, but most of those with abnormally high CDS for their genome size are labeled as “Chromosome”. In further work, the taxonomic identity of these outliers may be explored.\n Conclusion The genome sizes in this set of 11710 RefSeq representative prokaryotes vary by phylum and span nearly two orders of magnitude from the smallest at 0.185014 Mb to the largest at 16.0407 Mb. The median genome size was determined to be 4.050955 Mb and is a useful approximation that may be used to estimate, for instance, the number of genome equivalents in a given quantity of DNA, or in determining the number of genome equivalents required by a sequencing library preparation, or in determining the number of genome equivalents in the output of a DNA sequencing run.\nThis webpage was composed using R Markdown, and the Rmd file is available for download and may be viewed as a plain text file or by opening the file within RStudio.\n ","date":1598832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"2f7a1962561035c3841b1ca86b6b16ca","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/","section":"post","summary":"In this blogpost, I examine genome size among the 11,710 RefSeq representative prokaryotic genomes.","tags":["genomics","genome size","refseq","CDS"],"title":"Prokaryotic Genome Size","type":"post"},{"authors":["Radziah Wahid","Daniel Girma Mulat","John Christian Gaby","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"9875017c4ef388845f5603e37f8cfd87","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/wahid-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.248482Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wahid-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Commercial biogas upgrading facilities are expensive and consume energy. Biological biogas upgrading may serve as a low-cost approach because it can be easily integrated with existing facilities at biogas plants. The microbial communities found in anaerobic digesters typically contain hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which can use hydrogen (H 2) as a reducing agent for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into methane (CH 4). Thus, biological biogas upgrading through the exogenous addition of H 2 into biogas digesters for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 can increase CH 4 yield and lower CO 2 emission. Results: The addition of 4 mol of H 2 per mol of CO 2 was optimal for batch biogas reactors and increased the CH 4 content of the biogas from 67 to 94%. The CO 2 content of the biogas was reduced from 33 to 3% and the average residual H 2 content was 3%. At molar H 2 :CO 2 ratios  4:1, all CO 2 was converted into CH 4 , but the pH increased above 8 due to depletion of CO 2 , which negatively influenced the process stability. Additionally, high residual H 2 content in these reactors was unfavourable, causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and reduced CH 4 yields. The reactor microbial communities shifted in composition over time, which corresponded to changes in the reactor variables. Numerous taxa responded to the H 2 inputs, and in particular the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium increased in abundance with addition of H 2. In addition, the apparent rapid response of hydrogenotrophic methano-gens to intermittent H 2 feeding indicates the suitability of biological methanation for variable H 2 inputs, aligning well with fluctuations in renewable electricity production that may be used to produce H 2. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that the H 2 :CO 2 ratio has a significant effect on reactor performance during in situ biological methanation. Consequently, the H 2 :CO 2 molar ratio should be kept at 4:1 to avoid process instability. A shift toward hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was indicated by an increase in the abundance of the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium.","tags":["biological biogas upgrading","16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis","anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis","Methanobacterium"],"title":"Effects of H2 : CO2 ratio and H2 supply fluctuation on methane content and microbial community composition during in-situ biological biogas upgrading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smruthi Karthikeyan","Luis M.

The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling.

A large number of PCR primer sets have been developed for nifH amplification, and the effective deployment of these approaches should be guided by a rapid, easy-to-use analysis protocol. Bioinformatic analysis of marker gene sequences also requires considerable expertise. In this study, we advance the state of the art for nifH analysis by evaluating nifH primer set performance, developing an improved amplicon sequencing workflow, and implementing a user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline. The developed amplicon sequencing workflow is a three-stage PCR-based approach that uses established technologies for incorporating sample-specific barcode sequences and sequencing adapters. Based on our primer evaluation, we recommend the Ando primer set be used with a modified annealing temperature of 58°C, as this approach captured the largest diversity of nifH templates, including paralog cluster IV/V sequences. To improve nifH sequence analysis, we developed a computational pipeline which infers taxonomy and optionally filters out paralog sequences. In addition, we employed an empirical model to derive optimal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs for the nifH gene at the species, genus, and family levels. A comprehensive workflow script named TaxADivA (TAXonomy Assignment and DIVersity Assessment) is provided to ease processing and analysis of nifH amplicons. Our approach is then validated through characterization of diazotroph communities across environmental gradients in beach sands impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in a peat moss-dominated wetland, and in various plant compartments of a sugarcane field.IMPORTANCE Nitrogen availability often limits ecosystem productivity, and nitrogen fixation, exclusive to prokaryotes, comprises a major source of nitrogen input that sustains food webs. The nifH gene, which codes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme, is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in nature. In this study, a flexible sequencing/analysis pipeline, named TaxADivA, was developed for nifH amplicons produced by Illumina paired-end sequencing, and it enables an inference of taxonomy, performs clustering, and produces output in formats that may be used by programs that facilitate data exploration and analysis. Diazotroph diversity and community composition are linked to ecosystem functioning, and our results advance the phylogenetic characterization of diazotroph communities by providing empirically derived nifH similarity cutoffs for species, genus, and family levels.

Hence, the effect of feeding frequency on process variables and microbial community structure was investigated by comparing a laboratory-scale digester fed steam exploded food waste 10 times daily vs. one fed an equivalent amount once daily. The Frequently Fed Digester (FFD) produced on average 20% more methane and had lower effluent concentrations of long-chain fatty acids. Greater daily fluctuations in acetate, pH and biogas production rate could explain the lower specific methane yield and β-oxidation. Feeding frequency also influenced the microbial community whereby Tenericutes (42%) dominated in FFD but Firmicutes (31%) was most abundant in the Daily Fed Digester (DFD). Feeding frequency effects are therefore postulated to occur more often in digesters fed labile feedstocks at high organic loading rates.","tags":["16S","SSU rRNA","anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","CSTR","feeding frequency"],"title":"Feeding frequency influences process performance and microbial community composition in anaerobic digesters treating steam exploded food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silvia Greses","John Christian Gaby","Daniel Aguado","José Ferrer","Aurora Seco","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"0e2c8aa8d6ff3a9d608e66dab3e95db7","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/greses-2017/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.246879Z","relpermalink":"/publication/greses-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Microbial communities were thoroughly characterized in a mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), which were both treating recalcitrant microalgal biomass dominated by Scenedesmus. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis was performed when the AnMBR achieved 70% algal biodegradation and revealed high microbial diversity, probably due to the high solid retention time (SRT) of the AnMBR configuration. The bacterial community consisted of Chloroflexi (27.9%), WWE1 (19.0%) and Proteobacteria (15.4%) as the major phyla, followed by Spirochaetes (7.7%), Bacteroidetes (5.9%) and Firmicutes (3.6%). These phyla are known to exhibit proteolytic and cellulolytic capabilities required to degrade the Scenedesmus cell-wall. Methanosaeta was the most abundant methanogen detected in the AnMBR suggesting that methane was mainly produced by the acetoclastic pathway. In comparison, the thermophilic CSTR achieved 32.6% algal biodegradation, and its bacterial community had fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (977 OTUs) than the AnMBR (1396 OTUs), as is generally observed for high temperature biogas reactors. However, phyla with high hydrolytic potential were detected such as Firmicutes (34.6%) and the candidate taxon EM3 (38.7%) in the thermophilic CSTR. Although the functional metabolism of EM3 in anaerobic digesters is unknown, the high abundance of EM3 suggests that this taxon plays an important role in the thermophilic, anaerobic degradation of Scenedesmus. The abundant syntrophic bacteria and the detection of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the thermophilic CSTR suggest that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was the dominant pathway for methane production in this reactor.","tags":["anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","membrane technology","microbial community analysis","Scenedesmus spp.","16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis"],"title":"Microbial community characterization during anaerobic digestion of Scenedesmus spp. under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa J.

The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum -dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 ) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) reduction and 15 N 2 incorporation. A molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria ( Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae ). Despite higher concentrations of dissolved vanadium ([V] 11 nM) than molybdenum ([Mo] 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing, and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water contents. Incorporation of 15 N 2 was suppressed 90% by O 2 and 55% by C 2 H 2 and was unaffected by CH 4 and CO 2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C 2 H 2 -sensitive and C 2 H 2 -insensitive microbes that are more active at low concentrations of O 2 and show similar activity at high and low concentrations of CH 4 .","tags":["nitrogen fixation","diazotrophs","acetylene reduction assay","methanotrophs","Sphagnum","peatlands","peat bog","alternative nitrogenases","molybdenum nitrogenase","vanadium nitrogenase","Marcell Experimental Forest"],"title":"Molybdenum-based diazotrophy in a Sphagnum peatland in northern Minnesota","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

While degenerate PCR primers have been demonstrated to cause template-specific bias in PCR applications, the effect of such bias on qPCR has been less well explored. We used a set of diverse, full-length nifH gene standards to test the performance of several universal nifH primer sets in qPCR. We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.","tags":["amplification bias","quantification bias","degenerate primers","nifH","qPCR","nitrogenase","nitrogen fixation","diazotrophs"],"title":"The Use of Degenerate Primers in qPCR Analysis of Functional Genes Can Cause Dramatic Quantification Bias as Revealed by Investigation of nifH Primer Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Mirzaman Zamanzadeh","Svein Jarle Horn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600109299,"objectID":"8eda47576df440e61182d37b7d69f448","permalink":"https://chrisgaby.github.io/publication/gaby-2017/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T16:41:33.246059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gaby-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["16S","SSU rRNA","amplicon sequence analysis","anaerobic digestion","temperature-phased anaerobic digestion","biogas","biomethane","microbial community analysis","retention time"],"title":"The effect of temperature and retention time on methane production and microbial community composition in staged anaerobic digesters fed with food waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

Diazotroph diversity is typically quantified through the analysis of nitrogenase nifH gene sequences recovered from environmental samples. In this chapter we review the global census of diazotrophic microorganisms as assessed by the diversity of nifH gene sequences in public sequence databases. We assess the diversity of diazotrophs found in different environments and taxonomic groupings and we also evaluate PCR primers and probes used to assess diazotroph diversity. Furthermore, we assess the range of habitats and geographic regions in which diazotrophic diversity has been assessed. We find that diazotrophs in many habitats remain under sampled. We also find that nifH cluster III, which includes obligate anaerobes, contains the greatest diversity of nifH sequences and that anoxic environments both contain the greatest diversity of diazotrophs and are the environments in which diazotrophic diversity is most poorly sampled. Our knowledge of diazotroph diversity is likely to expand dramatically as next-generation sequencing technologies are targeted towards surveys of the nifH gene.","tags":["diversity","ecology","nifH","nitrogen fixation","nitrogenase","diazotrophs","PCR","primers"],"title":"Assessment of Nitrogenase Diversity in the Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.

The database contains 32 954 aligned nitrogenase nifH sequences linked to phylogenetic trees and associated sequence metadata. The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having textless3% sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23% dissimilarity in nifH. The nifH database has a number of uses including phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, the design and assessment of primers/probes and the evaluation of nitrogenase sequence diversity.

Numerous PCR primers have been designed to amplify nifH, but a comprehensive evaluation of nifH PCR primers has not been performed. We performed an in silico analysis of the specificity and coverage of 51 universal and 35 group-specific nifH primers by using an aligned database of 23,847 nifH sequences. We found that there are 15 universal nifH primers that target 90% or more of nitrogen fixers, but that there are also 23 nifH primers that target less than 50% of nifH sequences. The nifH primers we evaluated vary in their phylogenetic bias and their ability to recover sequences from commonly sampled environments. In addition, many of these primers will amplify genes that do not mediate nitrogen fixation, and thus it would be advisable for researchers to screen their sequencing results for the presence of non-target genes before analysis. Universal primers that performed well in silico were tested empirically with soil samples and with genomic DNA from a phylogenetically diverse set of nitrogen-fixing strains. This analysis will be of great utility to those engaged in molecular analysis of nifH genes from isolates and environmental samples.","tags":["nifH","PCR","primers","primer coverage","database","nitrogen fixation","nitrogenase","diazotrophs"],"title":"A comprehensive evaluation of PCR primers to amplify the nifH gene of nitrogenase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Christian Gaby","Daniel H.
